# PDB_OSD_HARDWARE

Power Distribution Board with Analog Video OSD Overlay circuit, Current Sense Circuit, TVS protector for ESC Voltage Peaks, regulator circuits and ATMEGA32U4 MCU.

Board is tested on a quadcopter with max 100A peak current delivered to 4 motors. TVS diode and filters are working fine where there is no interference to the analog video by ESC back EMF voltages.
